I'm building small, fast, and **physical** systems — from camera rigs to BLDC control + ML applications and digital Pinball Machines.


## Selected Projects


| Project | What it is | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| **Digitalized-8mm-Camera** | Super-8 analog camera revived with a Pi Zero + OV5647, wireless file sync, 3D-printed chassis. | Raspberry Pi • Python • OpenCV • CAD |
| **PiVision-Core** | Shared edge-vision framework for camera streaming, model inference, and smart notifications. | Python • Flask • OpenCV • Raspberry Pi |
| **PiVision-Face** | Facial recognition and alerting system built on PiVision-Core for door/entry monitoring. | dlib/face_recognition • Flask • MQTT/Notify |
| **WatchNest** | Built using my PiVision-Core. A Bird-feeder recognition module using lightweight CNNs for on-device species detection. | PyTorch Lite • OpenCV • Raspberry Pi 4 |
| **PyVESC-ML (fork)** | Extended VESC communication and ML-tuning utilities for automated controller optimization. | Python • VESC • Motor Control |

## Private Repos

Feel free to ask me about non-public projects, including HCI BLDC-Control with Odrive and a digital desktop-sized Pinball Machine
